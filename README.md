# Horror_Movie_Ratings

For my teammates and I, this was a fun introductory project on how to use R studio to complete basic hypothesis testing and confidence interval testing on data we selected and cleaned ourselves. This project was done around the same time as halloween, so we chose to be festive and looked into horror movie data. We found our data from the IMDb database, and were interested in seeing whether longer or shorter horror movies had higher average ratings on the IMDb scale of 1-10. We found that longer horror movies had higher overall ratings than short horror movies at a 95% confidence level, and the ratings on longer movies were between 0.4 - 0.8 higher on average.
